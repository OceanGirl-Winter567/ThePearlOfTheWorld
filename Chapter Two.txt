I do like to meet up with a few of some friends though, Selina and Iris Acantha. Their both sisters which is crazy because I never knew until about a year ago and now their both my best friends. I never go anywhere with out them, not with just one or the other, always both. Were just walking to school right now and I see a really tall man about 8th grade.
  "Hey, Kids, where ya headed?" he asked us in a thretaning voice.
  "Were just walking to our school" I answered nervously.
  "k your gonna pay for that prank ya'll pulled the other day!"
  "prank W-What? What happend?" Iris asked. 
  "you know what I'm talking about! C'mer!"
  We tried to run, but he knocked me off my feet and pulled my by the leg.
  "OW! WHAT IS THIS EVEN FOR!" I yelled.
  He didn't answer, he just bruised me up and droped me flat on my face. Then, he goes after my friends.
  "Wait!" I yell.
  Again he just beats us up. Iris after me, punching her, I'm surprised he didn't knock her out, he almost did though. 
  "stop..." I try to yell but my voice is gone for some reason. Maybe I just got really weak. Just to mention, It was 8:00 in the morning when this happend.
  Iris and me are now laying there, whatching as he beats up Selina. When he's done he grabs me by the hair, I pretend like he knocked me out.
  "FIGHT LITTLE WOLVES FIGHT!" he yells.
  I did fight back, eventhough I didn't even know how. I just struggled trying to get out of his grip, which was pretty hard. Selina was still standing and knocked the wind out of him just in time before I pass out in pain. He had to let go. I fell out of his hand and landed flat on my face again. That seems to happen pretty much every time I fall for some reason.
  Anyways, I managed to knock the wind out of him. I grabed my friends and ran. I ran until I couldn't breath.
  "I hope we don't run into him again" Said Iris.
  "yeah, I thought I was going to die, he was pretty dang strong for an 8th grader" Selina told us
  "well, the most important thing is that were all safe, but we should go see a doctor just in case. I feel kinda dizzy..." I said before I passed out.
  "ok I see why she would say that" Said Iris.
  Iris called for help and Selina was having a full-on panic attack. Five minutes went by and I woke up feeling loopy. Luckily, someone saw us and helped us out after Iris called for help.
  "hey, its gonna be fine, we called medical help, you feel ok?" Iris asked.
  "I don't know, I feel like I just got stabbed in the leg with I huge knife" I told them.
  Selina looked around for anything sharp that could
