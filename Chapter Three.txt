Medical arivved and I passed out again. This time I had a vision, a frightening one. I saw two guys pulling me by the arms. They were much older then me, about eighteen or so. I was dropped in a cage. Like a shark trap, as they dragged the cage I nocticed I was in a bad part of town, no wonder why this was happening. Every time I saw anyone walk by, I screamed.
  "Shut up!" one of the guys yelled. "Unless you want us to knock ya out"
  "dude, just give er' a sleepin' pill or somethin'" the other guy said.
  I tried to bend the metal bars and crawl out, that didn't work. I felt we were almost there, so I tired to puch a hole in the top of the cage. It took me a couple tries and a bloody hand. I stood up and climbed out.
  "hey! get back here!" I heard one of them shout. 
  I just kept on running until I found somewhere to hide. Luckily they were pretty stupid, I'm glad I got away. I called the police to come take me to the station or something. About ten minutes later, a helicopter came and got me. But the pilot kept saying 
  "wake up Cora!"
  It changed to Selina's voice. Then I fell, I fell until I landed on a hospital bed.
  "WHERE ARE THEY?" I shouted.
  "whoa whoa whoa, who are you talking about?" Selina asked me.
  "oh nothing, sorry" I responded.
  I guess I didn't die or I died in my vision. But it felt so real; almost like it was really happening. I tried to find anyone that would even possiblly be part of my vision, but no one fit the discription. But I think that should be how it is. 
  "Cora someone wants to talk to you..." Said Iris.
  "who?" I asked still confused on if I'm in real life or not. 
   "I don't know just someone" she responded.
  I glanced at Selina like she would know "don't look at me I don't know" she told me.
  I got out of bed and followed Iris down to a really weird area of the hospital. The wall paper was torn, there were old needles, old surgury beds, masks, it was like an abandoned part of the place.
  "hold on I for got something" Said Iris.
  It was right then she jabbed me with a needle which had sleepy stuff, but I tried to fight it. I couldn't. Though it did take a while to get me.
  "sorry I had to" Was the last thing I heard before driffting off.
