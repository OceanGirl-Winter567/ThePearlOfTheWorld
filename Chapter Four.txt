You would think I had another vision or something but no I hear and felt everything around me, and I felt like my head was floating off my body.
  "I had to gave her the anathisia or she would've ran off you know how she is" I heard Iris tell Selina.
  I could tell Selina didn't agree with Iris. Otherwise, why'd Iris say that?
  "of course you did, now how did you know she was who we were looking for?" Asked Selina.
  "You really don't remember the discription?"
  "oh, you just looked for that"
  "yeah, now shut up"
  I thought it was pretty harsh, but I didn't even know what was going on. So, I can't really say anything. The only thing I knew was that I was in trouble. One thing I wondered was why? Just why? Iris would always joke around about these kinds of things happening, but I never thought I would be the one to expieriance it. It was always something like "I might be the one to start a fight" It was pretty funny most of the time. But one time she went a little too far and pretended to try to charge at me. It was always me for some reason, and I guess this was the reason.
  "I just hope she's not faking it she fought it for some time" said Iris.
  "I'm not surprised she was always the stronger one mostly mentally, but she has had her take down moments" Responded Selina.
