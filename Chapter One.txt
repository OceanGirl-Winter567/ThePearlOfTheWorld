  Ok, before you judge me for trying to smash the ground with a hammer, hear me out. I've seen a lot of things that you would find in mythical stories. I've seen things from ghosts to immortal cursed piriets ect, I've even seen a goddess or two. Not just that but I've also seen dead poeple hunt for me.
