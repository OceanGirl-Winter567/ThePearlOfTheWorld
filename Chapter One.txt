  Ok, before you judge me for trying to smash the ground with a plastic toy hammer, hear me out. I've seen a lot of things that you would find in mythical stories. I've seen things from ghosts to immortal cursed piriets ect, I've even seen a goddess or two. Not just that but I've also seen dead poeple hunt for me. So if you say I haven't seen anything, think again.
  I'm Cora Estella, aka the queen of the galaxy. Everyone and mean EVERYONE knows me for
