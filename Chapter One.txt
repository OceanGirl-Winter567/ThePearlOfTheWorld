  Ok, before you judge me for trying to smash the ground with a plastic toy hammer like an arcade game, hear me out. I've seen a lot of things that you would find in mythical stories. I've seen things from ghosts to immortal cursed piriets ect, I've even seen a goddess or two. Not just that but I've also seen dead poeple hunt for me. So if you say I haven't seen anything, think again.
  I'm Cora Estella, aka the queen of the galaxy. Everyone and mean EVERYONE knows me for collecting the pearl of existince, it's what caused the big bang, it's what caused history to be...history. I didn't do it myself, though that would've been way less annoying. I did it with two others, Lydia Rivera and Oscar Herrans and lets say they fought a lot, at the wost times too. Here's how it went:
  "Cora! the bus is already here!" My mom called.
  "i'm not even packed yet!" I replied.
  "then why don't you stop smoothereing your face with makeup and pack!"
  I'm not even putting on makeup, but my mom likes to be told she's always right, otherwise...things get ugly. I'm not kidding, one time she broke a window with a pool noodle beacuse she wasn't hired for a bodygurd jod just so she could see celeberties everyday, she's not even fit for it.
